Data format
The presented instances are stored in two basic formats. We generally assume that n is the number of facilities and m the number of cities.

The first line consists of 'FILE: ' and the name of the file. In the next line n, m and 0 are denoted:
[n] [m] 0
The next n lines consist of the number of the facility, the opening cost and the connetion cost to the cities.
So for facility i (i = 1, ... , n) we have
[i] [opening cost] [cost of conneting city j to facility i] (j = 1, ... ,m)

Example: n = 4, m = 3
FILE: Exapmle.txt
4 3 0
1 300 130 120 80
2 400 140 100 50
3 150 130 90 140
4 200 100 120 150
