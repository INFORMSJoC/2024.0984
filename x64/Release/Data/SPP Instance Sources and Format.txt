SPP instances are sourced from the [SPP instance library](https://commalab.di.unipi.it/datasets/RDR/).

This is a simple generator for Sensor Placement Problem (SPP) instances.
The SSP has the MIQP formulation

   min \sum_{i = 1}^n a_i x_i^2 + c_i y_i

       \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i = 1

       0 <= x_i <= y_i    i = 1, ..., n

Accordingly, the format of the instances is

n
c_1
...
c_n
a_1
...
a_n

The generator generates two random instances at once, the "a" one with
large quadratic costs w.r.t. fixed costs, and the "b" one with "small"
quadratic costs w.r.t. fixed costs. Costs are generated as Gaussian
random numbers.

Usage of the generator is

gauss <q> <Coeff> <nrand>

where

  q      is the number of sensors

  Coeff  is the cost multiplicative factor

  nrand  is the "name" of the instance (appears in the filename)
